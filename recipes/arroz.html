    <h4>A receita mais simples de arroz branco. Só para acompanhar.</h4>
    <p>There are plenty of ways to cook rice. And in Portugal, there is no shortage! This one is a bit different though. Not only are we using already boiling water, but we're going to cook this Portuguese Rice in the oven, in a clay pot! What you'll get is a nice toasty rice, kind of crunchy, but kind of delicious too! From Lisboa to the north, Arroz seco no forno can accompany many meats and fish.</p>
